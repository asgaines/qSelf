# qSelf - quantified Self

Code behind the running of qSelf. Built as a showcase of learning to use Laravel (v5.0). Some proof-of-concept functions including adding database items, seeding, migrations, model/controller design, basic front-end design.

Most functionality is rather useless, intended only as a test of functionality.

Idea behind site is collecting data regarding the quantified self (biological data collected from biosensors/etc) and providing a central homebase for these data.
